Assignment: Password manager 2

Description:

the purpose of this lab was to implement the backend to a password manager app. 
I very much struggled with this assignment, but i managed to complete both of the controllers, models, and part of the password list view backend.
I really would appreciate some grace, and leniency with this assignment, as i struggled with it immensely. I have an incredible amount of work to do, with exams and finals.
I know i didnt do everything, but i hope this will allow me to get a few points.
